# Console-Finances

## Description

This is a JavaScript project which involves the use of finance and maths to allow a more comprehensive understanding of what the data is. This will further allow a wiser judgement on how to handle business based on financial data. The JavaScript uses formulas and statistics to give console.log() answers on what the mathematical findings are.

## Usage

Steps:
1. Open the page, which will be linked below.
2. Open up the inspect element in your desired browser.
3. Navigate to the console tab.
4. View Findings

## Credits

I have used many websites to better my understanding of how to utilise for loops and formulas for data manipulation.

I noticed at first glance that this is an array in an array I have never encountered before. By using the internet I found sources to "flatten" an array to manipulate it's containing data easily. This can be visualised and understood here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45659734/how-to-use-array-map-with-a-2-dimensional-array

Furthermore, my knowledge of finance was very limited since I graduated with a biochemistry master's I had no idea how to calculate data based off of profits and losses. I used this website to understand the formula: https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/month-over-month-growth-rate/

Additionally, I had no idea how to tackle the greatest increase and decrease in profits so by using W3Schools and other finance equations/understandings I was able to figure out a way to do this. I used this website to help me out: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_sort.asp
